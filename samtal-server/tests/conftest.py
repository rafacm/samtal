"""What every lane needs before it can build a server.

Device authentication is on by default, and an enabled auth with no
secret in the environment is a boot failure, so a lane that builds an
app needs a secret. Setting one here rather than turning auth off keeps
every lane running the way a real deployment does: real tokens issued
by the OTA endpoint and checked at the websocket handshake.

An already-exported secret wins, which is what lets the smoke lane point
at a container and sign with the secret that container was started with.

Set at import time rather than in a fixture: a test module that builds
the app while it is being imported (the boot test does) needs the
secret before collection, not before the first test runs.
