# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
using dates (`## YYYY-MM-DD`) as section headers instead of version numbers.

## 2026-08-02

### Added

- Waveshare ESP32-S3-Touch-AMOLED-2.16 (480×480 AMOLED, dual-mic AEC) listed
  as a planned target board.
- samtal-server stack decision: Python 3.12 + FastAPI (uv-managed), with the
  xiaozhi-sdk device simulator for hardware-free integration tests; pipecat
  considered as a later orchestration step.

### Changed

- Hardware tables now link each board's product page and technical
  documentation ("doc").

## 2026-08-01

### Changed

- New logo: a person and the device sharing one waveform, echoing the
  etymology of samtal (together + speech).
- Logo rebuilt as vector art: `assets/samtal-logo.svg` is now the source of
  truth, and `assets/samtal-logo.png` is rendered from it with a transparent
  background (fixes white edge pixels on dark pages).
- README header now shows the project logo (`assets/samtal-logo.png`).
- README rewritten in the style of clew.nvim: etymology header, early-development
  warning with 🚧 markers, feature bullets, hardware table.

### Fixed

- The vector trace of the logo had flattened the original color gradations;
  the SVG now uses real linear gradients on the orange and blue regions so it
  matches the raster original on both light and dark backgrounds.

### Added

- `AGENTS.md` with project conventions for coding agents, and `CLAUDE.md`
  referencing it.

- Project scaffold: `samtal-esp32/` (device firmware) and `samtal-server/`
  (conversation server) subprojects.
- `docs/xiaozhi-notes.md`: research notes on the upstream xiaozhi firmware and
  server, covering architecture, device↔server protocol, configuration, and the
  procedure used for the first working end-to-end demo on a Waveshare
  ESP32-S3-Touch-LCD-1.54.
- MIT license and third-party license notices for the upstream projects
  ([78/xiaozhi-esp32](https://github.com/78/xiaozhi-esp32),
  [xinnan-tech/xiaozhi-esp32-server](https://github.com/xinnan-tech/xiaozhi-esp32-server)).
